<h2>reCAPTCHA Overview</h2>
<p>A "captcha" is a program or test to diffrentiate between a human and a program. They are usually displayed as a garbled string of characters which humans can distuinguish easily, but computers cannot. A typical use of captchas on blogs are to prevent automated programs from filling up comment forms with unwanted advertisements.</p>
<p>The computer science department at Carnegie Mellon University designed the <a href="http://recaptcha.net">reCAPTCHA</a> application to harness a human's superior character recognition capabilites in the field of book digitizing with the usefulness of traditional captchas. Their website, <a href="http://recaptcha.net">reCAPTCHA.net</a>, provides more information.</p>
<p>To use reCAPTCHA, you must <a href="http://recaptcha.net/whyrecaptcha.html">register with their site</a> to recieve public and priviate keys for use on your website.</p>

</ol>

<h3>Plugin Configuration</h3>
<p>This is a pretty straight forward plugin to configure. You will need the public and private keys you were assigned when you signed up with reCAPTCHA.</p>
<h4>Plugin settings</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Enter the Public and Private keys you recieved when you signed up with reCAPTCHA.net.</li>
	<li>"Registration?" Check to enable reCAPTCHA on registration forms</li>
	<li>"Comment?" Check to enable reCAPTCHA on comment forms</li>
	<li>"Email?" Check to enable reCAPTCHA on email message forms</li>
	<li>"Exempt Users?" Check to let registered (and logged-in) users submit comments and messages without solving a reCAPTCHA</li>
	<li>"Enable SSL" Check _ONLY_ if your visitors are already interacting with your site over SSL already</li>
	<li>"Apply Theme?" box if you want to apply a different colored theme/tab index/language to the reCAPTCHA box.</li>
	<li>Choose your theme: red, white, blackglass, or clean</li>
	<li>Select the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-tabindex">tabindex</a> for the reCAPTCHA box.</li>
	<li>Select the language</li>
</ul>
<h4>Plugin variables (Advanced)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Code is set to "recaptch" by default; shouldn't need to be changed</li>
	<li>Priority identifies the order in which plugins are called. Lower numbers priorites will be called before higher numbers.</li>
	<li>Apply rendering? (<em>Author's note: I'm not quite sure how this variable is supposed to interact with the plugin and b2evolution. On my installation, it is set to "stealth", and works for me.  Future updates may clarify this setting.</em>)</li>
<h4>Plugin events (Advanced)</h4>
<p>Leave alone unless you know what you're doing!</p>
</ul>

<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
	<li>get incorrect solutions to return to the comment form and offer another try</li>
